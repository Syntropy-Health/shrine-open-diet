## TL;DR — what is this project?

A **unified diet knowledge graph** spanning macronutrients, foods, herbs, phytochemical compounds, molecular targets, and diseases — aggregated from 7+ open-source datasets, indexed in Neo4j (graph + vector embeddings) via LightRAG, and queried by LLM agents through 5 thin-adapter MCP primitives.

Primary use cases driving the design:
- **A. Symptom → food.** Given a symptom, surface foods/herbs whose bioactives have evidence-graded drug-target activity for the implicated targets/diseases.
- **D. Diet → predicted physiological effects.** Given a recorded diet (foods + portions), aggregate bioactive compound exposure → target modulation → predicted pathway/disease effects.
- **C. Compound mechanism dossier** (free from the same backbone): unified evidence card for any bioactive (e.g. quercetin) — structure, drug-likeness, targets, pathways, food sources.

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture decisions that meaningfully shape the system; each is dated, justified, and lists alternatives considered.

| ADR | Title |
|---|---|
| [0001](adr/0001-vector-storage-on-aura.md) | Vector storage on Neo4j Aura (vs separate vector DB) |
| 0002–0006 | _Reserved — see git history; not yet captured as ADRs_ |
| [0007](adr/0007-compound-identity-bridge.md) | Compound identity bridge + ChEMBL evidence layer (Phase 1 drug-bioactive) |

> **Convention:** new ADRs use the next free number, never reuse a number. If a decision is reversed, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one (don't edit the old one).

## Active feature specs & plans

These describe in-flight or recently-shipped work. Each pairs with an implementation plan and a runbook in `.claude/runs/`.

| Spec | Status |
|---|---|
| [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-06-drug-bioactive-bridge-design.md`](superpowers/specs/2026-05-06-drug-bioactive-bridge-design.md) | Phase 1 — landed via PR #19; ADR 0007; runbook at `.claude/runs/20260506-013000-drug-bioactive-bridge/` |
| [`docs/KG_COMPLETENESS_AUDIT.md`](KG_COMPLETENESS_AUDIT.md) | KG audit (this PR) — identifies 5 concrete completeness gaps + remediation specs |

PRD/plan/report/review documents from earlier phases live in `.claude/PRPs/{prds,plans,reports,reviews}/`. The legacy plans under `.claude/PRPs/plans/completed/` are kept for archaeology but should not be the primary reference for current architecture.

## Conventions

- **One canonical doc per topic.** If you find duplicate coverage, consolidate and link.
- **Cross-reference using relative paths** so renames are easier to track.
- **ADRs are append-only.** Reverse a decision by writing a new ADR; never edit a closed one.
- **Specs live under `docs/superpowers/specs/`** and follow `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` naming.
- **Runbooks live under `.claude/runs/<run-id>/`** when they accompany a dispatch-pvp execution.
- **Stale references** are a bug. If a doc points at a moved/deleted file, fix the link or remove the reference.

---

## Known gaps in this index

- ADRs 0002–0006 do not exist; the numbering jumps. Either re-number or add stub ADRs explaining what wasn't captured.
- `.claude/PRPs/plans/` has both active and completed plans, but the in-tree completed/ subdir is a partial archive — some "completed" plans live in the parent.
- No top-level `CHANGELOG.md` exists; release-level changes are tracked only via git tags + paper drafts.
