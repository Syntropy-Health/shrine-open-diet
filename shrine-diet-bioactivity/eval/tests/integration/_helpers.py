    """Verdict-direction-aware sanity bound on calibrator output.

    The calibrator (agents/calibrator.compute_confidence) is a deterministic
    weighted geometric mean of (evidence_tier, 1 - hdi_risk, question_fit).
    The result is "confidence the intervention is safe / recommended,"
    NOT "confidence the verdict is right." That asymmetry matters:

      - "prefer" verdict → high evidence + low HDI risk → confidence should be
        nontrivial (>= 0.3 with the current weights and any non-empty signal).
      - "reject" verdict → high HDI risk dominates the product → confidence
        should be low (<= 0.5); a "reject" with confidence 0.9 means the
        calibrator inverted.
      - "caution" / "abstain" → middle ground; only assert in (0, 1).

    These bounds catch calibrator-direction regressions without false-failing
    correct-but-low-confidence outcomes (e.g., the SJW+sertraline case).
