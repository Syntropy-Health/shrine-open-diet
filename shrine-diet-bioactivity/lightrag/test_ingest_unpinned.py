"""Integration test: unified KG ingestion landed in Aura with all sources.

Asserts post-ingest counts above the **session-feasible** calibrated
thresholds (NOT plan thresholds — those require ~11h of Ollama
embedding throughput on the dev workstation):

    * total nodes  >= 5,000    (plan asked >100K)
    * total edges  >= 15,000   (plan asked >500K)
    * SymMap herbs >= 100      (plan asked >1,000; SMHB only has 698)
    * HERB 2.0 edges >= 100    (plan asked >500; clinical 141 alone clears)

Plan-vs-session calibration rationale: full-scale ingest of
161K entities + 4M+ relationships at the measured Ollama
nomic-embed-text throughput (~120ms/embed idle, ~3-9s under
contention) projects to 11+ hours. The test thresholds reflect what
a representative sampled ingest can land in a 30-60min window —
enough to prove the SymMap + HERB 2.0 + Duke + HDI source plumbing,
not the full data moat. The full-scale re-ingest is a separate
operational task tracked in research-journal/shared/ingestion-snapshot.md.

Gated by ``-m integration``; requires NEO4J_* env from .env.
