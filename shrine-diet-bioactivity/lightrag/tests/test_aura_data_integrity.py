"""Aura/Neo4j data-integrity gates.

Verifies the indexed KG instance contains the expected entity/edge
mass per label. Skips cleanly when Neo4j credentials are absent (so
PRs from forks and local-dev runs without secrets pass instead of
fail).

The thresholds below are deliberately conservative — they catch
catastrophic regressions (empty index, half-loaded ingest) without
flapping when the upstream sources tick by ±5%. Bump them upward
only when an ingest run consistently exceeds the new floor.
