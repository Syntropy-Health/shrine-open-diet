# Unified Phytochemical Knowledge Graph with Graphiti Semantic Search

## Problem Statement

LLM dietitian agents answering health queries like "what foods help with chronic inflammation?" currently rely on parametric knowledge or fragmented data sources. The existing mcp-herbal-botanicals server bridges herbs to compounds to foods (Duke + FooDB), but lacks: (1) compound-target-disease relationships needed for mechanistic reasoning, (2) clinical evidence to ground recommendations, (3) ADME/pharmacokinetic properties for bioavailability assessment, and (4) semantic graph search for natural-language traversal across entity types. Without a unified, semantically searchable KG, agents produce shallow answers that can't trace the full pathway from symptom to molecular target to dietary intervention.

## Evidence

- Current MCP server has 11 tools but zero compound-target data (empty tables awaiting CMAUP)
- The `search-by-symptom` tool maps only 47 bioactivity-derived symptoms vs. 2,678 in SymMap
- No chemical-disease associations exist in the current schema — agents can't answer "what foods help with diabetes?" with grounded data
- Graphiti was previously rejected for wrong fit (episodic memory, not static reference) — but user now wants to experimentally validate this decision with a live deployment
- Multiple non-overlapping datasets (CTD, HERB 2.0, TTD, TCMSP) are freely downloadable and would add unique layers (phenotypes, clinical trials, druggability, ADME)

## Proposed Solution

Build a unified data manifest aggregating 8+ non-overlapping datasets into a single ETL pipeline, then index the resulting entity-relationship graph into both: (A) the existing SQLite/MCP server for deterministic tool-call queries, and (B) a Graphiti-powered Neo4j KG for semantic search and LLM agent retrieval. Run a live end-to-end experiment on Railway-hosted Graphiti + Neo4j instances, with local embeddings (LM Studio) to minimize cost. Document the comparative analysis: MCP tool-call queries vs. Graphiti semantic search vs. raw Cypher.

## Key Hypothesis

We believe that indexing structured phytochemical data into a Graphiti temporal knowledge graph will enable richer, more contextual agent responses compared to direct SQL tool calls — particularly for multi-hop queries (symptom -> compound -> target -> disease -> food) that require semantic traversal. We'll know we're right when the Graphiti-backed agent can answer 10 benchmark queries with more complete entity coverage and source attribution than the MCP-only approach.

## What We're NOT Building

- A production-grade deployment — this is an experiment on Railway test instances
- A new MCP server — we extend the existing mcp-herbal-botanicals
- Custom NLP entity extraction — we use Graphiti's built-in LLM extraction on pre-structured JSON
- A web UI — visualization uses Neo4j Browser directly
- Data cleaning/curation of upstream sources — we take datasets as-is with deduplication at join boundaries

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | How Measured |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Datasets integrated | 6+ non-overlapping sources in manifest | Manifest file audit |
| Entity coverage | 10K+ herbs, 100K+ compounds, 3K+ targets, 5K+ diseases | getStats() counts |
| Graphiti indexing | All core entities + relationships indexed in Neo4j | Neo4j Browser node/edge counts |
| Benchmark queries | 10 multi-hop queries answered by both MCP and Graphiti | Side-by-side comparison doc |
| Local embedding cost | $0 (local LM Studio) | No API billing |

## Open Questions

- [x] Can Graphiti handle 4M+ compound-food edges without OOM during ingestion?
  **RESOLVED**: No. With 8GB memory on both Graphiti and Neo4j, must subsample. Strategy: ingest all herbs (2,376), top 5K compounds, top 10K compound-food pairs, all targets/diseases. Compound-food edges are the OOM risk — hard cap at 10K.
- [ ] What is the embedding dimension of `text-embedding-embeddinggemma-300m-qat`? (Needed for Graphiti config)
  **PENDING**: Need LM Studio running to verify. Defaulting to 768 (GemMA-based models typically use 256 or 768). Run `make embedding-check` to verify.
- [x] Neo4j credentials for Railway instance — need password
  **RESOLVED**: `neo4j`/`demodemo` via TCP proxy `bolt://metro.proxy.rlwy.net:22971`. Verified connection works.
- [x] STITCH 5 is 200GB raw — is pre-filtering to our compound universe feasible in a single session?
  **RESOLVED**: Yes, feasible but not in this phase. Strategy: download only `9606.actions.v5.0.tsv.gz` (human interactions, ~4GB compressed). Pre-filter with a streaming script that checks each line's chemical_id against our compound_name_map (~94K compounds). Expected output: ~50K-200K rows (0.01% of 1.6B). This is a Tier 2 task — worth doing after CMAUP/CTD/TTD are validated, as it adds the largest compound-target interaction network. Implementation: stream with `zlib.createGunzip()` + `readline` (same pattern as load-ctd.ts), filter by CID prefix `CIDm` + normalizeCompoundName on STITCH's flat chemical IDs.
- [x] DisGeNET free tier limits — is the dhimmel/disgenet community snapshot sufficient?
  **RESOLVED**: Yes for experimentation. The [dhimmel/disgenet](https://github.com/dhimmel/disgenet) community snapshot provides ~380K gene-disease associations under ODbL license from the 2015 freeze. This covers the core GDA relationships needed for compound→target→gene→disease traversal. Limitations: (1) data is from 2015 (missing recent GWAS findings), (2) no variant-disease associations, (3) no disease specificity scores that the paid tier provides. For this experiment, the community snapshot is sufficient — it closes the gene→disease gap that CMAUP and TTD partially cover. Full DisGeNET would be needed only for production-grade clinical recommendations.
- [x] BATMAN-TCM has no bulk download — is scraping or author contact required?
  **RESOLVED**: Confirmed no bulk download. GitHub mirror has compound_list.txt (33,053 entries). Live API at `batman2api.cloudna.cn/queryTarget` accepts PubChem CIDs and returns compound-target mappings. A scraper script iterating 33K compounds would work but is rate-limited. For now, CMAUP's 15,204 compound-target associations (already loaded) cover the same space. BATMAN-TCM scraping deferred to Tier 3.

## Users & Context

**Primary User**
- **Who**: LLM dietitian agent (the Diet Insight Engine SDO) making tool calls to answer user health queries
- **Current behavior**: Calls 11 MCP tools on a SQLite DB with herb-compound-food data only; no target/disease/clinical layer
- **Trigger**: User asks a multi-hop question like "what foods contain compounds that target COX-2 for inflammation?"
- **Success state**: Agent retrieves a grounded, multi-source answer tracing symptom -> herb -> compound -> target -> food with citations

**Job to Be Done**
When an LLM agent receives a health-related dietary query, it wants to traverse a comprehensive phytochemical knowledge graph, so it can provide evidence-backed dietary recommendations with molecular-level mechanistic reasoning.

**Non-Users**
- End consumers (they interact with the agent, not the KG directly)
- Researchers doing batch analysis (this is optimized for real-time agent queries, not bulk analytics)

**Key Technical Decisions**

| Decision | Choice | Alternatives | Rationale |
|----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Graph DB | Neo4j (Railway) | Kuzu (embedded), FalkorDB | User has running Railway instance; Graphiti supports it natively |
| Embeddings | Local LM Studio (embeddinggemma-300m-qat) | OpenAI API, Voyage | Zero cost; OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| Graphiti integration | Python submodule | npm package, REST API | Graphiti is Python-native; TypeScript MCP server is separate concern |
| Data manifest format | YAML with JSON Schema | SQL migrations, Python dicts | Human-readable, versionable, tooling-friendly |
| Dedup strategy | Compound name normalization + PubChem CID | InChI key, SMILES | Matches existing normalizeCompoundName() pattern; PubChem CID as fallback |

**Technical Risks**

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Graphiti OOM on 4M+ edges | Medium | Batch ingestion with chunking; ingest compound-food edges last or sample |
| Local embedding dim mismatch | Low | Verify embeddinggemma output dim before configuring Graphiti |
| Neo4j Railway instance too small | Medium | Monitor memory; fall back to local Neo4j Docker if needed |
| BATMAN-TCM no bulk download | High | Skip or scrape subset; prioritize CTD + HERB 2.0 + TTD instead |
| LLM cost for Graphiti entity extraction | Medium | Use local LLM (LM Studio) for extraction too, or pre-structure JSON to minimize extraction calls |

## Approach Comparison: With vs Without Graphiti

### Without Graphiti (Current MCP-Only Approach)

```
Agent → MCP tool call (search-by-symptom, get-herb-compounds, etc.)
     → SQLite query with parameterized SQL
     → Structured JSON response
     → Agent composes answer from multiple tool calls
```

**Strengths:**
- Deterministic, reproducible results
- Sub-200ms query latency on indexed SQLite
- No LLM cost at query time
- Full control over query logic and result ranking
- Works offline (embedded DB)

**Weaknesses:**
- Agent must know which tool to call and chain calls manually
- No semantic understanding — `search-by-symptom("I feel tired")` requires exact symptom name match
- Multi-hop queries require 3-4 sequential tool calls
- No cross-entity similarity search (e.g., "compounds similar to curcumin")
- Adding new query patterns requires new MCP tools

### With Graphiti (Semantic KG Approach)

```
Agent → graphiti.search("natural language query")
     → Hybrid retrieval: semantic embedding + BM25 + graph traversal
     → Returns edges with facts, provenance, temporal validity
     → Agent gets pre-traversed multi-hop results
```

**Strengths:**
- Natural language queries without exact-match requirements
- Automatic multi-hop traversal (symptom -> herb -> compound -> food in one call)
- Semantic similarity enables fuzzy matching ("fatigue" finds "tiredness", "low energy")
- Temporal tracking — facts have valid_at/invalid_at timestamps
- Provenance — every fact traces back to source dataset
- Emergent relationships discovered during LLM-powered ingestion

**Weaknesses:**
- LLM cost during ingestion (entity extraction calls per episode)
- Non-deterministic — different LLM runs may extract slightly different entities
- Requires running Neo4j server (not embedded)
- Higher query latency (embedding + graph traversal + reranking)
- Overkill for simple lookups ("get compounds for herb X")

### Quality Comparison for LLM Agent Use

| Query Type | MCP Quality | Graphiti Quality | Winner |
|------------|------------|-----------------|--------|
| Simple lookup ("compounds in ashwagandha") | Excellent — exact, fast | Good but slower | MCP |
| Symptom search ("I'm tired") | Limited — needs exact symptom name | Excellent — semantic fuzzy match | Graphiti |
| Multi-hop ("foods with anti-inflammatory compounds targeting COX-2") | Requires 3-4 chained tool calls | Single semantic query traverses graph | Graphiti |
| Cross-entity similarity ("compounds like curcumin") | Not supported | Good — vector similarity on compound embeddings | Graphiti |
| Provenance ("where does this fact come from?") | Source column only | Full episode provenance with temporal tracking | Graphiti |
| Batch/analytics ("top 10 herbs by compound count") | Excellent — SQL aggregation | Poor — not designed for analytics | MCP |
| Offline use | Works fully offline | Requires Neo4j server | MCP |

### Recommended Hybrid Strategy

Use **both** in production:
1. **MCP tools** for deterministic, structured queries (lookups, aggregations, pagination)
2. **Graphiti** for natural-language semantic search, multi-hop traversal, and discovery queries
3. Agent routes queries based on intent: structured → MCP, exploratory → Graphiti

### Phase Details

**Phase 1: Data Manifest & ETL**
- **Goal**: Create a single manifest.yaml describing all datasets with schemas, download URLs, normalization rules, and dedup strategy
- **Scope**: manifest.yaml, download scripts for CTD, HERB 2.0, TTD (CMAUP + SymMap already planned)
- **Success signal**: All Tier 1 datasets downloadable via `scripts/download-datasets.sh`

**Phase 2: SQLite Integration**
- **Goal**: Populate all empty Phase 4 tables + new CTD/HERB/TTD tables in SQLite
- **Scope**: Migration scripts, compound name normalization across sources, new MCP tools for targets/diseases
- **Success signal**: `getStats()` shows 10K+ herbs, 100K+ compounds, 3K+ targets, 5K+ diseases

**Phase 3: Graphiti Setup**
- **Goal**: Clone graphiti as git submodule, configure for local embeddings + Railway Neo4j
- **Scope**: `git submodule add`, Python venv, Graphiti config with OpenAIEmbedder pointing to LM Studio, Neo4j connection to Railway instance
- **Success signal**: `graphiti.build_indices()` completes without error on Railway Neo4j
- **Neo4j connection**: `bolt://neo4j-test-2be3.up.railway.app:7687` (or proxy `metro.proxy.rlwy.net:22971`)
- **Embeddings**: `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/embeddings` with model `text-embedding-embeddinggemma-300m-qat`

**Phase 4: Graphiti Indexing**
- **Goal**: Ingest all core entities and relationships into the Graphiti KG
- **Scope**: Python ingestion script using `graphiti.add_episode()` with `EpisodeType.json` for structured data; batch processing with progress tracking
- **Success signal**: Neo4j Browser shows all entity types as nodes with labeled edges

**Phase 5: Benchmark & Comparison**
- **Goal**: Quantitative comparison of MCP tool-call vs Graphiti semantic search
- **Scope**: 10 benchmark queries spanning simple lookups, multi-hop traversals, semantic similarity, and natural language symptom queries
- **Success signal**: Comparison document with entity coverage, latency, and quality scores per query

**Phase 6: Visualization & Docs**
- **Goal**: Document how to visualize the Neo4j KG and reproduce the experiment
- **Scope**: 
  - Local: `docker run neo4j` + Graphiti config for localhost
  - Cloud: Neo4j Browser at `https://neo4j-test-2be3.up.railway.app:7474` (HTTP) or Neo4j Desktop connecting to bolt URI
  - Cypher query examples for exploring the graph
  - Architecture decision record: MCP vs Graphiti vs hybrid
- **Success signal**: New team member can visualize the KG in <5 minutes following the guide

### Parallelism Notes

Phases 2 and 3 can run in parallel — Phase 2 works on SQLite schema/data while Phase 3 sets up the Graphiti infrastructure. Both depend on Phase 1 (manifest) being complete. Phases 5 and 6 can also partially overlap since documentation can begin while benchmarking runs.

---

## Research Summary

**Market Context**
- No existing open-source project combines all 7+ datasets into a single queryable KG for LLM agents
- Graphiti is the leading open-source temporal KG framework but designed for conversational memory, not static reference data — this experiment tests that boundary
- The 2024 Frontiers assessment found only 295 compounds shared across all 8 major TCM databases — confirming low overlap and high additive value from multi-source integration

**Technical Context**
- Existing mcp-herbal-botanicals has clean patterns (Zod schemas, HerbalDBAdapter, vitest) that extend naturally
- Graphiti supports custom OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoints and Neo4j bolt connections — confirmed in source code
- The 4.1M compound-food edges are the largest single relationship set; Graphiti ingestion may need batching/sampling
- Railway Neo4j instance is already running; Graphiti test instance at graphiti-test.up.railway.app is available
